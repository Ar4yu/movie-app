# MovieFinder

A sleek and intuitive movie discovery app built with **React + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and powered by the **TMDB API** and **Appwrite**. The app allows users to search for movies, explore trending titles, and get simple recommendations—all within a fast, modern UI.

## Based On

This project was inspired by and partially based on a tutorial by **JavaScript Mastery**:

[Build and Deploy a React Movie App | JavaScript Mastery (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLhUialKPQ)

> I followed this tutorial as a learning resource.

## Project Overview

The app fetches movie data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and allows users to:

- Search for movies by title
- View trending/popular movies
- Get movie card details (poster, rating, summary, etc.)
- Track searched movies via Appwrite (optional backend)

### Simple Trending Algorithm

The **trending movies** section pulls data from a backend (Appwrite), which tracks how often a movie appears in a user’s search. The process is:

1. A user searches for a movie.
2. If a valid result is returned, the app records the **first result**.
3. These are stored with a **search count** per movie ID.
4. The app then sorts the list by **highest search count**, creating a basic but effective popularity tracker.

> This logic is handled in the backend using Appwrite’s database, making it simple but extendable for future personalization.
